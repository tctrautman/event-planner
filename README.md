# Event Planner

This is a small gatsby.js app used to visualize events.  Each horizontal "lane" represents an "event team," and the number of horizontal lanes at a given time represents the number of teams that are a working. 

This project had two main challenges:

1. Writing an algorithm to "pack" an array of events into the minimum number of horizontal lanes.

2. Using `css grid` (my first time using it in a significant way,) to visually display events are the correct start and end date.
